# Cash Register Application

This application was built as part of a freeCodeCamp course on JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures. It simulates a cash register system, calculates the change due to the customer, and determines the status of the cash register (OPEN, CLOSED, or INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS) based on the available cash in the drawer.

## Features

- **Customer Input**: Allows users to input the amount of cash given by the customer.
- **Change Calculation**: Computes the change due in the smallest denominations available.
- **Cash Register Status**: Displays the status of the cash register (OPEN, CLOSED, or INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS).
- **Responsive Design**: Layout adjusts for various screen sizes for optimal usability.
